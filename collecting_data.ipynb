    "The foundation of your project will be to collect appropriate data for the problem you are trying to solve. There is incredible versatility in how you can use an machine learning model. Some examples might be to predict the next social media trend, categorizing cancer cells, trying to better understand the relationship between temperature fluctuations and coffee bean growth rates, or creating a chat bot.\n",

    "Since we are very early in this course, and - most likely at this point - have not discussed many models, it may be difficult to know what you can do with a dataset, or what is in scope of this course. So by the nature of the course title \"Exploring Machine Learning\" we will take an explorative approach to your project. \n",

    "        'Neuroscience': 'Ive been fascinated with human behavior ever since my first psychology class in high school. My teacher was very passionate about the field that our classroom became more than just a space to learn-it was a space for deep discussions and debates, so much we would overextend our discussions after the last bell rang. Even though Neuroscience was not part of the curriculum, my teacher insisted we learn about this because she knew we would develop great interest in it and overall introduce us to the science behind the brain, what is known thus far. Since then, Ive developed a strong passion for understanding human behavior, and neuroscience allows me to explore this in real time. Im especially intriguied by why we do the things we do, why are their patterns amongst human personalities, how does our mind begin to forget everything we once loved? It is truly mind blowing! My goal one day is to work alongside Psychedelic Therapy or Neuroengineering to innovate new ways to treat mental illnesses and disorders.' ,\n",
    "        'Dancing': 'Dancing holds a special place in my heart. Growing up in a latin household I have always been surronded by so many different genres of music, all in which have its own dancing style to. Whether it was a family party, birthday, a graduation, etc. We would dance to bond with one another, laugh, and just have a great time overall. From a young age my older cousins began teaching me how to dance so I would be able to enjoy the family parties with them as I grew older. Little did I know this would change the course of my life! In Latin culture it is common to celebrate a girls 15th birthday as a change of a little girl to now a young woman, at these parties it is known to create a surprise dance to perform to the invitees. I had one of my own and choregraphed this alongside a family friend, then it turned to me choregraphing my neighbors 15th, another friends, and the list kept going. Eventually, I also would participate in a lot of these dances because of my ability to dance well. Overtime, I eventually began to branch out and really wanted to learn other styles of dance, I really wanted to make something out of dance because it is one of the few things I felt confident about. While this dream did not happen, I still have a strong love towards dance and hopefully in the near future, I could create a small dance academy of my own for various dancing styles for young girls and boys to pursue instead of just making it a small hobby!' , \n",
    "        'Dog Psychology': 'I have had two dogs in my life and have always been very attached to them. I cannot help but notice how intelligent dogs really are, from being able to perform tricks, chores, etc. Dogs are extremely loyal to their owner despite it not being its birth mother, its behavior is so fascinating, how did dogs come to love humans so much? Along with this, dog psychology offers insight into how dogs perceive human emotions and adapt to human environments, helping us better address issues like separation anxiety, aggression, and phobias, leading to happier, more well-adjusted pets.' ,\n",
    "        'Economics': 'A lot of people may think that economics is the study of money but really itâ€™s the study of human behavior in the face of incentives and constraints. What I love about economics is how it helps us understands how human beings come together and form institutions like markets in an organic manner and the room this analysis gives us to create policy for human development' ,\n",
    "        'Lifting': 'Weightlifting serves as an outlet to step away from daily stress with school or work. It is one of the few times that I am able to step away from all electronics and everything and really just focus on myself and work on myself. Weightlifting allows me to challenge myself with different workouts or different lifting styles. While it is something that I use for myself, I believe it is something I could possibly use in Neuro, linking behavioral effects whether positive or negative from weightlifting.'\n",
